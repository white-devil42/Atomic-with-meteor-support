Atomic 1.18 but it supports meteor

## Downloading

You can download this from the `client` folder. There is only one file in there, so i dont think you can download the wrong thing. Download and drag
into your 1.18+ mods folder to use.

## Installation

### GNU/Linux <!--on top-->

1. Download java 17
    - `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre` on ubuntu/debian
    - `sudo pacman -s jre-openjdk` on manjaro/arch
    - `echo "you're on your own, good luck"` on gentoo
   <!--tbh i never used fedora so I can't help them-->
2. Extract java 17 to a folder of your choice
3. Tell your 1.18 minecraft instance to use that java 17, if it doesn't automatically do it
4. Install [fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for 1.18
5. Drag the .jar into the `~/.minecraft/mods` folder, fabric api is required.
6. Launch fabric loader for 1.18 via the minecraft launcher

### Windows

The default launcher should already choose java 17 for the runtime, so you're free from steps 1-3

1. Install [fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for 1.18
2. Drag the .jar into the `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods` folder, Fabric API is required
3. Launch fabric loader for 1.18 via the minecraft launcher

### Mac

1. Install [fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for 1.18
2. Drag the .jar into the `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods` folder
3. Launch fabric loader for 1.18 via the minecraft launcher
